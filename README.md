# ECON-323-Final-Project
Repository hosting the final project for UBC Econ 323 class. 
The project aimed at using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict sovereign debt crises using macroeconomic indicators.
It then compares the result to the random effect probit (REP) widely used in academic studies.
The Excel tables used in the code are also available via the repository.
